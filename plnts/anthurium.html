    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Anthurium is a genus of herbs often growing as epiphytes on other 
        plants. Some are terrestrial. The leaves are often clustered and 
        are variable in shape. The inflorescence bears small flowers 
        which are perfect, containing male and female structures. 
        The flowers are contained in close together spirals on the spadix.</p>

     <p>Beneath the spadix is the spathe, a type of bract. 
         This is variable in shape, as well, but it is lance-shaped 
         in many species. It may extend out flat or in a curve. 
         Sometimes it covers the spadix like a hood. The fruits 
         develop from the flowers on the spadix. They are juicy 
         berries varying in color, usually containing two seeds.</p>
